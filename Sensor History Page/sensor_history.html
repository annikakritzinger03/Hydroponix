                            Water level plays an important role in hydroponics as it ensures proper plant growth and
                            nutrient uptake. Thus, the water level in a hydroponics system should be constantly
                            monitored.<br>The system is designed in such a way so that the user will receive a
                            notification
                            if there is too little water in the system or if there is a water leak.<br>Water level
                            shouldalso be monitoredfor the following reasons:

                                impacting
                                their overall health and development.

                        <p>
                            Just like water level monitoring, flow level monitoring is essential in a hydroponics system
                            to
                            ensure the proper circulation and distribution of nutrient solutions to plants. By
                            monitoring
                            the flow level, the teachers can help maintain consistent nutrient delivery, prevent clogs
                            or
                            blockages in the system and optimize water and nutrient usage.<br> Just as the water level
                            monitoring, the system will notify the user if the flow is either steadily decreasing or if
                            the
                            flow level is at a dangerous level.<br>The consequences to for not monitoring flow levels
                            are as
                            follows:

                                Uneven nutrient distribution: Inconsistent flow levels may result in uneven distribution
                                of
                                nutrients to plants, leading to nutrient deficiencies or excesses in certain areas.

                            Monitoring temperature in hydroponics systems is crucial for maintaining optimal growing
                            conditions and ensuring the health and productivity of plants. Temperature directly impacts
                            plant metabolism, nutrient absorption, and overall growth. Fluctuations in temperature can
                            lead
                            to stress, reduced nutrient uptake, and susceptibility to diseases and pests. By regularly
                            monitoring temperature levels, growers can make informed adjustments to maintain the ideal
                            temperature range, promote healthy plant development, optimize nutrient absorption, and
                            prevent

                            directly dissolved in water and delivered to plant roots, eliminating the need for soil.
                            This
                            method allows for precise control over nutrient levels and ensures that plants receive the
