              Both Penn State and Belgium Campus partake in this incredible hydroponics project, where students are
              given the opportunity to collaborate with international partners for a quarterly period. <br />
              This offers the following benefits for students involved in this project:

            <p class="interacting-with">
              <img class="leaf-1" src="img_about_us/leaf.svg" />
              Interacting with students from another university (and another culture) provides students with the
              opportunity to learn about different traditions and allows students to see and understand different
              perspectives and opinions, which improves creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<br />
              <img class="leaf-2" src="img_about_us/leaf.svg" />
              Working with students from another university and cultures encourages collaboration and teamwork, allowing
              for
              better informed decisions to be made.<br />
              <img class="leaf-3" src="img_about_us/leaf.svg" />
              Participating in the project offers students a hands-on learning opportunity outside of class.
              Additionally,
              various soft skills and hard skills will be learned in the process of discovering more on hydroponics
              systems.<br />
              <img class="leaf-4" src="img_about_us/leaf.svg" />
              Students have access to the opportunity of presenting a prototype of the system to primary school
              students. This will
              allow students to come up with new and interactive ways of explaining the system to encourage
              participation and spark an interest
              of hydroponics in these students.

              The project can be broken up into three subsystems. However, it is also important to note that while
              there will be three project teams, the subsystems must be able to successfully and seamlessly integrate
              with each other to form the larger system. <br />The three teams and their design domains are as follow:
