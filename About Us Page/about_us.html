                Both Penn State and Belgium Campus partake in this incredible hydroponics project, where students are
                given the opportunity to collaborate with international partners for a quarterly period. <br />
                This offers the following benefits for students involved in this project:

                Interacting with students from another university (and another culture) provides students with the
                opportunity to learn about different traditions and allows students to see and understand different
                perspectives and opinions, which improves creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<br />
                <img id="leaf-2" src="Images/leaf.svg" alt="Leaf bullet" />
                Working with students from another university and cultures encourages collaboration and teamwork, allowing
                for better informed decisions to be made.<br />
                <img id="leaf-3" src="Images/leaf.svg" alt="Leaf bullet" />
                Participating in the project offers students a hands-on learning opportunity outside of class.
                Additionally, various soft skills and hard skills will be learned in the process of discovering 
                more on hydroponics systems.<br />
                <img id="leaf-4" src="Images/leaf.svg" alt="Leaf bullet" />
                Students have access to the opportunity of presenting a prototype of the system to primary school
                students. This will allow students to come up with new and interactive ways of explaining the 
                system to encourage participation and spark an interest of hydroponics in these students.

                  This project (ENGR 422 for Penn State, and PRJ 381 for Belgium Campus)
                  includes the design,
                  fabrication, test, and presentation of a working hydroponics prototype. It ultimately aims to teach
                  middle school students the importance of nutritional food, general hydroponics concepts, and the
                  engineering principles of hydroponics in a practical, fun, and hands-on manner! It emphasizes
                  <span class="green-text">the transformation of communities through education-based engineering.</span>
                  This can be further expanded on by considering that the project must be
                  culturally accepted, relevant to the community, and also a long-term solution.

                The project can be broken up into three subsystems. However, it is also important to note that while
                there will be three project teams, the subsystems must be able to successfully and seamlessly integrate
                with each other to form the larger system.<br />
                The three teams and their design domains are as follow:

                Focuses on water flow and structures such as pipes. They are responsible
                for the primary physical tructure, as well as the monitoring of nutrients and water factors. 
                They are also responsible for the development of a mobile app - download it

                Focuses on electrical aspects and controls. They are responsible for
                technical aspects such as power constraints and sources, data handling and processing, and the 
                WiFi/networking of the system. They are also responsible for creating and managing NodeRed flows
                that work with the sensor data.<br />

                Focuses on lighting and plant health. We are responsible for lighting details, such as type,
                location, and light mapping, as well as all plant-health related factors, including nutrient intake and ensuring
                that other environmental factors are in the correct ranges. We are also responsible for
                the design, build, and management of this website.
