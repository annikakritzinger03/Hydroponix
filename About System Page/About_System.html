        <h1>ABOUT THE SYSTEM</h1>

        <h2>The Hardware</h2>
        <section id = "hardware">
            <img src="Pictures\Hydroponic system.jpg" alt="">
            <p>We chose to utilize PVC pipes, each capable of hosting five plants,
               as our preferred setup for the hydroponic system. 
               This configuration was selected with the intention of providing
               an illustrative and comprehensive display of the system's functionality
               and benefits. By incorporating a pump into the design, we effectively
               manage water circulation, promote oxygenation within the nutrient solution,
               and facilitate the even distribution of essential nutrients to all plants,
               thus ensuring optimal growth and vitality throughout the system.</p>

        <h2>Why Spinich?</h2>
        <section id = "spinich">
            <img src="Pictures\young-spinach.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Spinach presents an excellent choice for hydroponic cultivation due to
                its adaptability to controlled environments and rapid growth rate.
                With its shallow root system and high nutrient requirements, spinach
                thrives in hydroponic setups where nutrient solutions can be
                precisely regulated. Additionally, spinach's compact size makes 
                it well-suited for vertical farming and space-efficient hydroponic
                systems, allowing for high yields in limited spaces. Its nutritional
                density and versatility in culinary applications further enhance its
                appeal as a prime candidate for hydroponic cultivation.</p>

        <h2>The Software</h2>
        <section id = "sensor">
            <img src="Pictures\Sensors.jpg" alt="">
            <p>In a hydroponic system, the integration of light, pH, and flow 
               sensors plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal growing conditions
               for plants. Light sensors regulate the intensity and duration of
               artificial lighting, ensuring that plants receive the appropriate 
               amount of light for photosynthesis. pH sensors monitor the acidity
               or alkalinity of the nutrient solution, allowing for precise adjustments
               to maintain the ideal pH level for nutrient uptake by the plants.
               Flow sensors, on the other hand, monitor the movement of water 
               and nutrients throughout the system, enabling the adjustment of
               flow rates to prevent overwatering or underwatering. 
               Together, these sensors contribute to the efficient management of
               the hydroponic environment, promoting healthy plant growth and maximizing yield.</p>
