        <h2>The Hardware</h2>
        <section id = "hardware">
            <img src="Pictures\Hydroponic system.jpg" alt="">
            <p>We chose to utilize<span class="Highlight"> PVC pipes</span>, each capable of <span class="Highlight">hosting five plants</span>,
               as our preferred setup for the hydroponic system. 
               This configuration was selected with the <span class = "Highlight"> of providing
               an illustrative and comprehensive display of the system's functionality
               and benefits</span>. By <span class = "Highlight">incorporating a pump into the design, we effectively
               manage water circulation, promote oxygenation within the nutrient solution,
               and facilitate the even distribution of essential nutrients</span> to all plants,
               thus ensuring optimal growth and vitality throughout the system.</p>

        <h2>Why Spinich?</h2>
        <section id = "spinich">
            <img src="Pictures\young-spinach.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Spinach presents an excellent choice for hydroponic cultivation due to
                its <span class = "Highlight">adaptability to controlled environments and rapid growth rate</span>.
                With its shallow root system and high nutrient requirements, spinach
                <span class = "HIghlight">thrives in hydroponic setups where nutrient solutions can be
                precisely regulated</span>. Additionally, spinach's compact size makes 
                it well-suited for vertical farming and <span class = "Highlight">space-efficient hydroponic
                systems, allowing for high yields in limited spaces</span>. Its nutritional
                density and versatility in culinary applications further enhance its
                appeal as a prime candidate for hydroponic cultivation.</p>

        <h2>The Software</h2>
        <section id = "sensor">
            <img src="Pictures\Sensors.jpg" alt="">
            <p>In a hydroponic system, the integration of light, pH, and flow 
               sensors plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal growing conditions
               for plants. <span class = "Highlight">Light sensors regulate the intensity and duration of
               artificial lighting, ensuring that plants receive the appropriate 
               amount of light for photosynthesis</span>. <span class = "Highlight">pH sensors monitor the acidity
               or alkalinity of the nutrient solution</span>, allowing for precise adjustments
               to maintain the ideal pH level for nutrient uptake by the plants.
               <span class = "Highlight">Flow sensors, on the other hand, monitor the movement of water 
               and nutrients throughout the system</span>, enabling the adjustment of
               flow rates to prevent overwatering or underwatering. 
               Together, these sensors contribute to the efficient management of
               the hydroponic environment, promoting healthy plant growth and maximizing yield.</p>
